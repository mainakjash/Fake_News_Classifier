Fake news encapsulates pieces of news that may be hoaxes and is generally spread through social media and other online media. This is often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas. Such news items may contain false and/or exaggerated claims, and may end up being viral by algorithms, and users may end up in a filter bubble. This model classifies the news items to be fake or real with more than 92% accuracy.
